Remote browser controlled Spotify app for Android. Let's you control a Spotify app (not the official one) from a browser.

* Use android spotify sdk to connect to android
* Mimic android app features where possible
* Connect back to webserver for instructions
* Instructions settable via browser client

Simple right?
